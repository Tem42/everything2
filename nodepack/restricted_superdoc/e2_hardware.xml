  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;We are currently about 2/3rds of the way thru the approval process to move to Michigan State University.  There is an important meeting on the 17th, after which we may get a reasonable date to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are operating off the following machines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB0 - Dual Athlon 1800MP, 1gb of RAM, two 18gb SCSI drives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB1 - Athlon 2100, 1gb of RAM, two 18 gig SCSI drives and 1 120 IDE drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web0 - P3 500mhz, 512mb RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web3 - P3 600mhz, 512mb RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following machines are sitting loaded in my office and will be integrated into the cluster for the move:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web1 - Athlon 2400, 1gb of RAM, 1 40gb + 1 80gb IDE drive - [avalyn]'s donation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB2 - Dual-core Athlon 3800+, 2 80gb SATA2 drives, 2gb 800mhz RAM - Donations funded new machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web2 - Sempron 2600, 768mb RAM, 120gb IDE drive - [nate]'s donation, but is currently having random reboot issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we move, I will likely set up the site entirely on the new hardware at MSU and change the domain so we will not require much downtime.  I will then gather the old hardware and reload it with our new standard install which is Ubuntu server 6.06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has other machines they would like to donate which are P4/Athlon 2000+ or faster, or any gigabit networking hardware, please email me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;Someone has generously donated two additional machines and some networking gear and some hard drives.  Thanks a bunch, I think I should be able to put this stuff together.
