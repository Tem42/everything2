  <doctext>&lt;a href=http://nightscape.net/projects/e2/store/poster_full.jpg&gt;HERE IS THE POSTER AS IT STANDS&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt; the two nodes I don't like:
&lt;p&gt;
[Nothing New about Ancient Greece Will Be Learned Until the Vatican is
Plundered] by [donfreenut]
&lt;p&gt;
-- I love the title, but the actual writeup strikes out...
&lt;p&gt;
[Everything2 is decadent and depraved] by [knifegirl] looks like it's the responding half of a conversation.
&lt;p&gt;please email me &amp;lt;nate@everything2.com&amp;gt; with suggestions
for good nodes to put in the poster.
