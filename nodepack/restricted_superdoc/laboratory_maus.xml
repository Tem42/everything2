&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align=center&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Released during 1972, in the midst of that period's blundering excesses,&lt;br&gt;&quot;No. 1 Record&quot; was an essential breath of fresh air.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;#8212; [Brian Hogg]'s [liner notes] to #1 Record, [1986]

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Album&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 Record (accurate in that it was in fact their first record, but wildly inaccurate in terms of reflecting actual album sales) was [Big Star]'s opening gambit in what would be a career of musical greatness but personal disaster. Fronted by [Alex Chilton] and [Chris Bell], with [Jody Stephens] on drums and [Andy Hummel] on bass, Big Star had been known, in its pre-Chilton days, as [Ice Water]. When Chilton, disillusioned after the [Box Tops]'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; demise, returned to [Memphis|Memphis, Tennessee], began hanging around [Ardent Studios], and teamed up with Bell and company and they renamed the band Big Star, after the &quot;Big Star Foodmarkets&quot; across the street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;Recording&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rehearsals were spread over several months, marked by the founding of the [Ardent] record label,

which was to have [distribution] through [Stax Records]. #1 Record was recorded in [1972] and 

released that same year; produced by the band themselves and engineered by Ardent's [John Fry], 

it fell on [deaf ears] upon its release. Stax's distribution proved woefully inadequate, and 

even a later deal with [CBS Records] to help distribution did little to alleviate the problems. 

Following the album's release, intraband tensions led Bell to leave the band, leaving Chilton

and the other two surviving members to continue on and record [Radio City] and [Third/Sister Lovers],

with only the former seeing official release during the band's lifetime. Probably Big Star's most

accessible album, and one which has greatness only matched (and in a way, surpassed) 

by the following two albums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;CD Release&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 Record was coupled with Radio City and released in CD format in [1992] by Stax; a [24-bit remaster]ed

version is available, and both versions include well-written liner notes by [Brian Hogg] and [Rick Clark].

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Feel]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Bell/Chilton&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;I feel like I'm [dying], I'm never gonna live again&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Beginning with a lightly overdriving and saturated guitar, Feel kicks off the album in style, though Bell's belted vocals take a little getting used to in comparison to Chilton's relatively softer tones. Features a memorable [brass]-section solo done in unison with the band's regular instruments. Not the best indication of what is to come, but a fine way to kick off the record.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[The Ballad of El Goodo]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Bell/Chilton)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;I'll [fall] if I don't fight, and at my side is God&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[Capo]ed guitars ringing out and Chilton's vocals prompting the listener to &quot;Just a-hold on&quot;, this is Big Star at one of its best moments. At turns defiant (&quot;And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round&quot;) and vulnerable (&quot;I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted&quot;), this song would come to illustrate Chilton's future in the music industry.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[In The Street]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Not a thing to do, but [talk] to you&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my non-Big Star friends still know this song - it was covered by [Cheap Trick] and serves

as [theme song] to [That 70's Show]. This version is far better, the intertwining guitars of the

intro and the euphoric vocals providing one of the better &quot;[heavy]&quot; Big Star songs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[Thirteen]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Would you be an [outlaw] for my love?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any description of this song can't fully do it justice; [sungirl]'s description in the [Thirteen]

node is as good as they come. Rather than try to re-hash what she has put so well, I advise the

reader to instead take a look there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[Don't Lie to Me]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Don't [cross] me babe&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Star [old-fashioned] [rock-and-roll] at its best. Beginning with the sound of the band getting

ready to play and then kicking off with a great [riff], this was one of the album's singles; it [flop]ped,

but remains nonetheless a good showing that Big Star &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; rock out when needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[The India Song]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Hummel)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Drink [gin and tonic] and play a grand piano&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written by bass player Hummel and arguably the least &quot;traditional&quot;-Big Star sounding song on the

album, this is a simple tune about going to [India], meeting a girl, and finding contentment. The

[instrumentation] is very [60's] sounding, and recalls that of late-period [Beatles].



&lt;strong&gt;[When My Baby's Beside Me]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Coz when my baby's beside me, I don't [worry]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other single released off the record, it follows in a similar style to Don't Lie to Me, but

with a much more optimistic tone. Featuring a very [70's]-typical &quot;ringing [chord]&quot; to bring in 

each verse, another muscle-with-brains song to kick off the second side with style.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[My Life is Right]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Eubanks)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;When you're around, my life's [worthwhile]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bell's finest [composition] and vocal, My Life is Right can be seen as a reply to Chilton's

assertion that he's found the right girl - &quot;when my baby's beside me, I don't worry&quot;, claims the

latter; &quot;Lonely days of uncertainty, they disappear when you're near me&quot; replies the latter.

Normally such lyrically similar tracks would cancel each other out when placed in [sequence] on 

an album, but in this case they compliment each other - Chilton's song a more defiant, proud

assertion while Bell's is calmer and more reflective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[Give Me Another Chance]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;You know I just don't [think before I speak]&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Chilton's most gorgeous compositions, it finds its narrator vulnerable and humble - not

very common in Chilton's #1 Record-era [output], and all the more convincing for it. &quot;Don't give up

on me so fast&quot;, he [plead]s, and the song's closing harmonies are some of the strongest on the

record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[Try Again]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;[Lord], I've been trying to be what I should&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Stately] and [hymn]-like, Try Again finds its roots in Memphis [soul] and finds Bell both confused

(&quot;I feel the pain&quot;) and determined (&quot;But I'll try again&quot;). Terrific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[Watch the Sunrise]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It's okay to look outside - the day it will [abide]&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an opening [12-string] guitar riff worthy of [The Byrds], Watch the Sunrise is probably

the most musically-acomplished song on the record; the [pre-chorus]' vocal harmonies (&quot;Okay&quot;,

&quot;outside&quot;) complement Chilton's vocals perfectly, and the ringing guitar resonates far after

the song is finished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;[ST 100/6]&lt;/strong&gt;

(Bell/Chilton)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I'll show you [somehow]&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only four lines of lyrics and an arpeggiated guitar forming the main instrumentation, 

this is best seen as a coda - it would be Bell's goodbye to the group, and he goes out in style,

the close-harmony vocals ocassionaly [spine-tingling]. As it draws to a close, you just want to

press [play] and start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The [Technical] Side&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The [Musician]s&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;[Chris Bell]&lt;/b&gt;: [guitar], [vocal]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;[Alex Chilton]&lt;/b&gt;: guitar, vocal&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;[Andy Hummel]&lt;/b&gt;: [bass], vocal&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;[Jody Stephens]&lt;/b&gt;: [drums] &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;The Facts&lt;/strong&gt;
