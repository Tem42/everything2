&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[/edb]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is a fun command, that allows you to control [EDB]. For example: if you type:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/edb *burp*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
in the chatterbox, you would see:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;[EDB]&amp;gt; *burp*&lt;br /&gt;
To make EDB do an action, you could type something like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/edb /me eats everybody's toe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
which would show:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;i&gt;[EDB] eats everybody's toe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
--&gt;
Misc. chatterbox commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/topic&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This allows you set the chatterbox topic.  It can only be done by gods.  Also, you can set a longer topic by going to [Room Topics] and setting the value for room 0. -[JayBonci|jb]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/sayas&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This allows you to talk as one of the bots. &lt;b&gt;Stay in character&lt;/b&gt;, and please be sure not to harass too much, as people may not understand we're just messing with them.  
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/sayas webster I am a dictionary
&lt;li&gt;/sayas edb I am hungry
&lt;li&gt;/sayas eddie Just chillin
&lt;li&gt;/sayas klaproth I ate your common sense
&lt;/ul&gt;
You can also use the /me message with them so:&lt;br&gt;
/sayas edb /me is hungry!!! &lt;br&gt;
works.  Have fun now&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[chatterbox forwards]
     &lt;dd&gt;Create an &quot;alias&quot; for a user in the chatterbox.  
For instance, /tell [bones] will send a message to 
[dem bones]
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[nate] sez&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:  
To create a chatterbox forward you have to do two things:
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;First, have the user reserve the account they want to 
use as an alias.  If [jessicapierce] wants [jayp] she 
needs to reserve the account, so the [jayp] user won't 
log on and not be able to get msgs.  Put down &quot;Chatterbox Forward&quot; as the '[name]' under the new account.
     
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Second, enter the alias in the &quot;&lt;b&gt;[chatterbox forward]&lt;/b&gt;&quot; setting -- include underscores in the &lt;i&gt;aliased&lt;/i&gt; name, but not in the target name.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Gorgonzola]&lt;/b&gt; sez: 
&lt;br&gt;OK, that's nice, but a little vague. What you'll see in [chatterbox forward] is a list of entries of the form:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;the_Lord_GOD&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gorgonzola&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the &lt;b&gt;Setting&lt;/b&gt; side, add the &quot;alias&quot; name, replacing any spaces with underscores. On the &lt;b&gt;Value&lt;/b&gt; side, put the name of the actual user who is supposed to receive the messages.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus &quot;/msg the_Lord_GOD&quot; will send a message to [nate].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite anything you might have heard, forwards are CASE SENSITIVE -- put capital letters on the &lt;b&gt;Setting&lt;/b&gt; side where capital letters are supposed to appear in the alias.&lt;br&gt; Thus, &quot;/msg gz&quot; would send messages to me, but not &quot;/msg GZ&quot;. If I want a GZ entry, it has to be added separately.   Similarly, &quot;/msg the_lord_god&quot;, &quot;/msg The_lord_God&quot;, or other  variations will not send to nate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted, most people want forwards to make it easier to send them /msgs., so capital letters in forwards are a bit silly.  But still, that's the way it is. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other bit of advice: Forwards don't work with the blab! in writeups.   

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, back to [nate]:
&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Please offer this service to users who chose a long, cumbersome name 
but please wait until they've made some investment around here or everybody
and his brother will be in line for this and our [chatterbox forward] page will
be out of control.  I suggest waiting until they're 3rd level unless they look
particularly promising.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;XP-related functions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[bless]
     &lt;dd&gt;Adds 10 GP to a user's total.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;To bless a user, go to the user's [home node] and click the &lt;b&gt;bless&lt;/b&gt; link in your [Epicenter] nodelet.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;(-kg)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[bestow 25 votes]
     &lt;dd&gt;Adds 25 votes to a user's total votes.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;To bestow votes on a user, go to the user's home node and click the &lt;b&gt;bestow 25 votes&lt;/b&gt; link in your Epicenter [nodelet].
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is actually my favourite way of encouraging users. They gain GP and also participate further in the voting process. I always ask them if they would like the votes, why I am doing this, and to &quot;use them wisely and well to help guide the nodeflow.&quot; [sensei]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[superbless]
     &lt;dd&gt;Bless a user with a specific amount of GP
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;[nate] sez&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Pretty straightforward - go to the [superbless] doc, and type the user's nick and the amount of GP.  

&lt;/dl&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;Getting rid of nodes/writeups&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;Deletion
     &lt;dd&gt;The fundamental difference between content editors and gods removal powers is the 'delete' button, located above your epicenter.  Clicking delete will remove an entire node (or single writeup, or any other kind of page on E2, including the front page) and send it to [The Node Crypt] if it's an e2node, user or writeup.  Don't delete users (see below).  Deleting does not send a Klaproth msg.  It's often used on nodeshells, though [the nodeshell hopper] is more efficient.  It's a nuke from orbit.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Room manipulation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  &lt;dt&gt;[locking rooms]
     &lt;dd&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[nate] sez&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;If you go into a non-system room (ie one you create yourself, or one a user has created)
you will see a [lock] link in the Other Users nodelet.  Clicking on this will lock the room, making it impossible for any other users to enter.  Note: gods can also lock/unlock rooms from the room's node.  Once locked, the link will change to [unlock] which will reverse the process.
&lt;p&gt;
To set a topic, particularly if you need HTML, edit [Room Topics]. For a list of all rooms see [Available Rooms].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Removing users&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Removing a &quot;Troll&quot; account:&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;dd&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;[alex|I] would prefer to have all &quot;troll&quot; bans run by me and have me pull the trigger.  This is a serious action and it's just easier to have it all lead back to one person. If a user is out of line in the catbox, please defer to members of the [chanops] group or call in an [e2contact] person. If they're noding up a storm of dross, you can suspend posting/voting/C! privileges via their home nodes. If there's a troll epidemic or coordinated activity (like the time we had some [The Stile Project|Stile Project] issues), please wait for me or one of my deputies (currently [wertperch], [The Debutante], or [Oolong[user]]) to give the order to crack down before axing accounts. Generally there is no urgency and often there is no need to remove an account once it's been neutralised.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(--[alex])&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[deleting a home node]&lt;/dt&gt;
     &lt;dd&gt;Homenode content may be removed for gross asshattery. Posting other people's data or content, putting in Goatse or exploit links, porn, or other expressly forbidden content justifies the removal of that content. Spam accounts, defined as accounts obviously created solely for the purpose of posting ads in their homenode, may be summarily deleted. You will typically find that these accounts were created early to mid-morning, US/Eastern, and originate in southern Asia. Almost all accounts created from the Philippines, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka fall in this category.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Locking a User Account&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only the aforementioned heavy hitters should lock an account without consulting [alex|me]. Be cautious.



     &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking down multiple accounts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
     &lt;dd&gt;[nate] has given us a special tool (we can only hope it's because we're special). Here's the deal: he created [ip2name] and linked it from [the oracle] -- if you think someone's using multiple accts, you can check by entering their username into [the oracle|oracle], and following the link next to &quot;[ipaddy]&quot;. &lt;b&gt;Please use sparingly -- 'spensive query.&lt;/b&gt; ([N-Wing] says: this works by checking for matching IP addresses, so it can be easily defeated if a user has a dynamic one (like somebody stuck on a puny modem) (so if people do not match, it does not mean that they are not the same))&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Straight-up editing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[editing node titles]
     &lt;dd&gt;Users sometimes misspell node titles or make [namespace]d titles (which is frowned upon). Gods can fix these errors, change capitalization (&lt;i&gt;like for example the atrocious practice of capitalizing articles and prepositions -[wharfinger|w]&lt;/i&gt;), or clarify node names by editing their titles.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;To edit a node title, start from the node you wish to edit. At the main [node] page (as opposed to an individual [writeup]'s page), click the &lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt; link just above your Epicenter nodelet. A text box will appear that contains the current node title. You can edit the title there as necessary, then click &lt;b&gt;submit&lt;/b&gt;.
	 &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Editing a node's title does NOT edit the titles of its individual writeups; see next paragraph. 
	 &lt;br&gt;
	 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(-kg)&lt;/i&gt;

	 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE ALSO THIS:&lt;/b&gt; The writeup's title is what gets displayed in User Search and &quot;Cool User Picks!&quot;. It's important to fix the writeup titles too. You can edit each one independently, but that's painful. There's a (slightly) better way: When a writeup is submitted, its title is updated to match that of its parent node. You can just right-click the writeup type, open a new browser window, click &quot;sumbit&quot;, and get on with your life. &lt;/p&gt;

	 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(-[wharfinger|w])&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[editing writeups]
     &lt;dd&gt;Any writeup can be edited by a member of the [gods] group. This includes Webster_1913's writeups as well as users' home nodes. Writeups should be edited when there are misspelled [hard link]s, to add hard links to an otherwise worthy writeup, to add HTML tags to make the writeup more readable, and in other rare cases. When editing writeups, we should be careful not to change the meaning. If a writeup contains misinformation, it is better to add an additional writeup with the correct information.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;To edit a writeup, click the &lt;b&gt;person&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;place&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;idea&lt;/b&gt; link at the top of the writeup. This will present you with a text box containing the writeup exactly as the original noder submitted it. There you can make your corrections, then click &lt;b&gt;submit&lt;/b&gt;.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(-kg)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[editing Webster 1913's writeups]
     &lt;dd&gt;Webster write-ups need to be edited differently than other noder-created write-ups. Webster write-ups are of type &quot;definition&quot; which is not a type that is normally available for write-ups. SO... When you go to a definition node, click the &quot;&lt;b&gt;definition&lt;/b&gt;&quot; link at the top of Webster's write-up. That will bring you to a page for the write-up itself. Click the &quot;&lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt;&quot; link above your Epicenter. Make sure that &quot;definition&quot; is highlighted in the Writeuptype box. Edit the write-up and click &lt;b&gt;submit&lt;/b&gt;. This is why editing Webster is such a pain in the ass. It takes extra steps to get it right.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(-kg)&lt;/i&gt;

	 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	 &lt;dd&gt;Incidentally, this &quot;[definition]&quot; writeup type is handy if you object to having people vote on your [editor log]s. Just make it a [definition], and they &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; vote on it. They can still &lt;b&gt;C!&lt;/b&gt; it, though, and that's a drag. Of course, we may have random users demanding that we make all the daylog writeups into definitions, and all the dream logs, and blah blah blah . . . 
	 &lt;br&gt;
	 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(-[wharfinger|w])&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     
     &lt;dt&gt;[rearranging write-ups]
     &lt;dd&gt;Write-ups are generally displayed in the order that they were created (in &quot;full&quot; node display, the earliest write-up appears at the top of the node). Webster 1913's write-ups should always appear at the bottom of the node. It is sometimes necessary to reorder write-ups to put Webster at the bottom, or to highlight a particular write-up within a node. You can rearrange the order of write-ups using the editor panel. (Is there an official name for this?)
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Click the &lt;b&gt;launch editor&lt;/b&gt; link at the top of the node, just beneath the node title on the left side. The editor panel will open.  There you can click on a write-up title and use the &lt;b&gt;up&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;down&lt;/b&gt; links to move it around. When you are done, click the &lt;b&gt;Save&lt;/b&gt; button then the &lt;b&gt;close&lt;/b&gt; link to close the Javascript panel. Do exactly that to avoid a bug that has made such lists vanish in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Node Funerary Rites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[The Node Crypt]
     &lt;dd&gt;Available as a link in your [Epicenter] nodelet, the Crypt will keep you informed as to the deletion situation for all nodes, home-nodes, writeups and nodeshells for up to the past 48 hours.  Every two days the Crypt empties into [Node Heaven].  The Crypt time could be seen as a Purgatory.  In any case, the bottom line is all deleted text can easily be cut/pasted and given back to the author should the need arise.  Mistakes and reconsiderations can be properly resolved.  Often there's a good writeup in a bad GTKY node and this is ideal for returning the text to the author and requesting it find a place elsewhere.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(--[dem bones|bones])&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[Node Heaven]

     &lt;dd&gt;As a God you're given &quot;visitation rights&quot; in Node 
Heaven.  You can type in any user's name and see what they 
have had nuked.  Unfortunately, the database doesn't currently 
note the time of a nuking and nodes are listed chronologically 
with an option to offset any number.  It kinda sucks but 
it's still helpful.  Between this and the 
[the node crypt|Crypt] it's become easier to go through a 
noder's history and see where they're at/where they're going 
and very easy to resolve &quot;problems&quot; arising from potentially 
good nodes that were sent to their death.  Two months ago if
a writeup/node was nuked that was pretty much it unless you
took the time to save their text or they backed it up (still
highly recommended) ... now you don't have to waste your time
being &lt;i&gt;so damn careful&lt;/i&gt;!  In fact, you could cut/paste
your [editor log] out of either [the node crypt|the Crypt], 
[Node Heaven] or [Who Killed What].  &lt;p&gt;
In any case, it's pretty simple to answer user questions about
a nuke and just as easy to have the writeup be re-posted if 
there's a valid protest.


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(--[dem bones|bones])&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[Who Killed What]
     &lt;dd&gt;A third way to cross-reference all of this killing 
is [Who Killed What].  Any God can type in an editor's 
username and get a list of what that editor has deleted, again
with an option to 'offset' any number of entries.  This is a
simple way to keep an eye on where we're all at and keep a nice,
cold, paranoid eye on [dannye] in case Gore wins and we
wake up without a [Findings] page or something...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A note about restricted superdocs:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After creating a restricted superdoc you have an option to set who &quot;maintains&quot; that doc.  Anybody from joe-user up to 'best users' are options.&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(--[dem bones|bones])&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
     &lt;dt&gt;[Alphabetizer]
     &lt;dd&gt;You'll never guess how this works!  Drop in any list, one entry per line, and you'll get an alphabetized list with [html] BR tags as a bonus.  Very convenient way to re-arrange stuff like [Everything's Recipes].

     &lt;dd&gt;Again, quite simple.  Keeps a chronological list of all docs, superdocs and restricted superdocs being created. You may also sort by title and author, as well as filter by author.

&lt;h1&gt;Reparenting write-ups&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The new way:  [Magical Writeup Reparenter]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;When viewing a writeup, look in your epicenter for [reparent writeup].  Click on that, then fill in it's new home, submit it, and you are set.  Not so bad, eh?  The old method is still in this doc, but commented out. - [JayBonci|jb]
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moving All of One Account's Writeups to a New Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;
If a user wishes to change usernames and have all of their writeups moved to their new account, this is entirely possible and relatively painless, assuming the user is willing to meet you halfway. The process is two simple steps:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user should make a line-separated list of all of their writeups they wish to have reparented to their new account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should go to [Renunciation Chainsaw], copy the list into the large text box, enter the appropriate usernames into the two boxes at the top, and sumbit that mofo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Resurrecting write-ups&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the easiest way to resurrect a write-up is by removing it from [Node Row] before it gets into the crypt.  Just peruse Node Row for the write-up in question and click the Remove link attacked to that writeup.  The writeup will continue to appear as Marked for Destruction in the actual node for a short while until something or other in the database resets itself.  But then it will look like it did before it was killed. (&lt;i&gt;-[knifegirl|kg]&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We have available to us resurrect buttons in both Node Heaven, and the Node Crypt. If a writeup/node/user/usergroup/etc has been deleted, this will put it back into play with the exact same node_id.  If there is already something at that node_id, it will overwrite what is there.  Please use this very sparingly, as it's overuse could severely undermine the authority of the editorial staff and fellow administrators.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;When writeups make it back into play, there are certain... differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is a writeup, it starts unparented. There is a warning on top of the node saying such. You'll need to use [Magical Writeup Reparenter] on it to put it back in a node.  You might have to recreate a nodeshell or something for this.
&lt;li&gt;The writeup keeps its rep, but loses its C!s and actual vote counts. People can vote on this writeup again, and can re-C! it.  Coming back from the grave has its disadvantages.
&lt;li&gt;E2nodes do not automatically get back the writeups that were in them. Deletion of the node breaks the two way link that these items have.  It starts as a nodeshell.  If you accidentally whacked an e2node, you need to raise the parent e2node first, then all of the writeups, reparent all of the writeups back to the main node, and then click &quot;repair node&quot;.  All is not well, but it is as good as it is going to get.
&lt;li&gt;Resurrected E2Nodes have no softlinks.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Basically dealing in node unlife is ugly, and should only be done as a last resort.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A working alternative to [Node Bucket]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is not for the faint of heart. &lt;b&gt;Do not&lt;/b&gt; attempt if you are using any browser other than Netscape. It relies heavily on the editor panel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;View the write-up you wish to move. Make sure you are viewing the individual write-up, not a whole node.
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;b&gt;edit&lt;/b&gt; link above [Epicenter].
&lt;li&gt;Find the &lt;b&gt;parent e2node&lt;/b&gt; field; type the name of the node you want to move the writeup to.  For example, if I was looking at &quot;Beethoven (idea),&quot; I would type &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Ludwig Van Beethoven&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; into the &lt;b&gt;parent e2node&lt;/b&gt; field.
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;b&gt;submit&lt;/b&gt; button. The writeup will be &lt;i&gt;duplicated&lt;/i&gt; at Ludwig Van Beethoven (to continue with the above example).
&lt;li&gt;View the entire original node ([Beethoven] in this case.) Launch the editor panel by clicking the &lt;b&gt;launch editor&lt;/b&gt; link. (Again, if you're using any browser but Netscape, you should never have started this.)
&lt;li&gt;In the editor panel, find the writeup you just duplicated.  (You will have to remember its place in the node, from top to bottom.) Click it once to highlight it in the panel, then click &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;. Click &lt;b&gt;Save&lt;/b&gt; then click &lt;b&gt;close&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; If there is only one write-up in the node, you will NOT be able to delete it in this way. My suggestion is for you to make a temporary write-up in the original node before starting this process. Then, after you've gotten through this step in the reparenting process, you can mercy kill your own temporary write-up.
&lt;li&gt;Go to the new node ([Ludwig Van Beethoven]). You can again use the editor panel to rearrange the write-ups into proper date order, if you wish. Remember that Webster goes on the bottom.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Please talk to [knifegirl|me] if these instructions aren't clear; it's a lot of steps (and, therefore, a pain in the ass).

&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating Usergroups&lt;/h1&gt;
How to create and modify usergroups:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new node &lt;i&gt;usergroupname&lt;/i&gt; of type usergroup.
&lt;li&gt;Go to the homenodes of the users you wish to add to the group. At each homenode, click 'Add &lt;i&gt;username&lt;/i&gt;' in the Node Bucket (in Epicenter).
&lt;li&gt;Once you have the users in the node bucket, go to the &lt;i&gt;usergroupname&lt;/i&gt; usergroup node. Click the checkboxes next to the user names in the bucket
that you wish to add to the group. Make sure 'Execute and Drop' is checked, then click the 'Add to group' button in the Node Bucket. This will empty your
Node Bucket into the usergroup.
&lt;li&gt;The first user in your Node Bucket will be listed first and be marked as the leader of the group. As far as I can tell, this means nothing. To edit the 
order of the names in the usergroup (and thus the leader), from Netscape launch the pop-up node editor and rearrange. Follow this procedure &lt;strong&gt;to 
delete users from the usergroup&lt;/strong&gt;. Note that if you delete the &lt;EM&gt;bottom&lt;/EM&gt; user in the list, you will need to select another user by clicking their user name before pressing &lt;tt&gt;Save&lt;/tt&gt;, or the change will not be stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;: Unless the leader is an E2 admin (and even then, you should probably do this), you must also add them to the [usergroup owners] settings table. The &quot;key&quot; (first entry) is the usergroup's node ID and the the &quot;value&quot; (second entry) is the usergroup leader's node ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To contact the group in the chatterbox, type /msg &lt;i&gt;usergroupname&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Managing Usergroups&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to manage a usergroup's messages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All usergroups [should|will] have an entry in the [usergroup message archive manager] table. A new group will be set to &lt;kbd&gt;(stay not archiving)&lt;/kbd&gt; by default. If you want to turn message archiving on (or off) for the usergroup:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the usergroup in the alphabetical list
&lt;li&gt;Change the drop down to &quot;start archiving&quot; or &quot;no archiving&quot; as needed
&lt;li&gt;Check the checkbox beside the drop down
&lt;li&gt;Press Submit (or equivalent) at the bottom of the table.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Usergroup message archiving is be enabled (or disabled, if that was your fiendish plan). If you want to link the message archive from the usergroup node, edit it and place this into it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;hr&gt;
 &lt;kbd&gt;&amp;#91;{linkGroupMessages}&amp;#93;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;kbd&gt;&amp;#91;{linkGroupMessages:&lt;EM&gt;your_name_here&lt;/EM&gt;}&amp;#93;&lt;/kbd&gt;
 &lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The optional argument &lt;EM&gt;your_name_here&lt;/EM&gt; is the user to &lt;kbd&gt;/msg&lt;/kbd&gt; to join the group; with any spaces converted to underlines. It results in this message being displayed to folks who are not in the group:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 You aren't a member of this usergroup. To join, &lt;kbd&gt;/msg your_name_here&lt;/kbd&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to grant the weblog (&lt;strong&gt;*ify!&lt;/strong&gt;) command to a usergroup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Much simpler code created!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grant the ify! command, simply surf over to the usergroup's homepage, type in the desired display name (&quot;Edevify&quot;, &quot;Sportify&quot;, etc) and hit the add ify! button. This does three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds the usergroup to the [webloggables] setting page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates every member's var to include the usergroup on their &lt;b&gt;can_weblog&lt;/b&gt; userVar for instant usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tacks the weblog on to the end of the usergroup's page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Access [unhideify!] to reset any &quot;hidden&quot; *ify settings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[N-Wing] babbles: one of the most annoying things of being a superuser is that the tools are in a zillion places and are very inconsistant. Just remember at least you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; the tools, unlike [%
return '&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO actual correct percentage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;' if $$USER{node_id}==9740;
'99%';
%] of the noder population. Just be careful not to do anything like disabling the ability for users to login ([not me|that did happen once]). &lt;strong&gt;If you aren't sure what something does, just ask.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More to come. Gods, feel free to edit or add to this as you see fit.
