  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;[N-Wing|I]'ve done a few things in code for April Fool's Day before. I thought it may be of interest to [edev]ers and other Perl programmers what some of the things were. This superdoc explains some of code of the things done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(If I already have this somewhere else, er, oops! Please let me know. &amp;mdash; [N-Wing])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm just cleaning out old junk for now, so there isn't any formatting or anything pretty like that. Sorry. --N-Wing, 2006-03-31(5)&lt;/p&gt;
