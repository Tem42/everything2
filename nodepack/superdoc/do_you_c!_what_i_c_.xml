&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picks up to 100 things you've cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finds everyone else who has cooled those things, too, then uses the top 20 of those (your &quot;best friends.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finds the writeups that have been cooled by your &quot;best friends&quot; the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows you the top 10 from that list that you haven't voted on and have less than 10C!s.&lt;/li&gt;
