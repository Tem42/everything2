  -- &lt;em&gt;the [Mad Hatter] to Alice (from [Lewis Carroll | Lewis Carroll's] [Alice in Wonderland])&lt;/em&gt;&quot;,
  
  &quot;No, we won't think noble because we're not noble. We won't live in [beautiful harmony] because there's no such thing in this world, nor should there be.

  -- &lt;em&gt;[Friedrich Nietzsche], [Beyond Good and Evil]&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, 
  
  &quot;I don't remember what the point was, but actually {[Bill Gates]} conceded that I was right and then just moved on, which I found extremely scary that he would consider something, consider his own position, consider this alternative view, weigh the merits of each argument, and then adopt the best view.

 &quot;It was because he wanted there to be [conspirator | conspirators]. It was much better to imagine men in some smoky room somewhere, made mad and cynical by privilege and power, plotting over the [Courvoisier | brandy]. You had to cling to this sort of image, because if you didn't then you might have to face the fact that bad things happened because ordinary people, the kind who brushed the dog and told their children [bedtime stories], were capable of then going out and doing horrible things to other ordinary people. It was much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If is was Us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &quot;Oh that bug, that is no bug, that is a creature I mean feature, a new evolutionary [CPU] from [Intel], it creates different answers for you to rely on and those companies that survive will be stronger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &quot;I would have loved to be a fly on the wall this morning to hear the first words out of [Jerry Sanders]' mouth when he heard of the 1.13GHz [Pentium III] recall. For that matter, I would have loved to hear the conversation when Micky D. called Barrett this morning. I would have loved to see the look on Barrett's face when his secretary said, 'Craig, Michael's on the phone and he  sounds [a little pissed].'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  -- &lt;em&gt;[Bill Jackson], on [Dell]'s single sourcing and public bashing of [AMD] products&lt;/em&gt;&quot;,

  -- &lt;em&gt;[Jerry Sanders]&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, 
 
 &quot;Only a fool would bet against you. After all, it's not [RAMBUS] or [Willy] it's the benchmarks....! Reminds me of [Star Trek] [OS] episode (later in a movie) about the '[Kobiashi Maru]'...the no win situation...what do you do? You change the rules! [Intel] will change the benchmarks!

 &quot;...a [Gateway] Select commercial came on. In the commercial they were talking about the superior [AMD Athlon] processor. Then at the end they showed the Gateway screen with the AMD logo where the [Intel] logo usually is.

 &quot;It looks like they tried the 'Get 9 women, I want that baby in a month' approach
 -- &lt;em&gt;[Bill Jackson], on the [Coppermine] chipset&lt;/em&gt;&quot;,
 
 &quot;It's not just the arrival of chips which match -- or out-perform -- the [Pentium III]; and it's not just the total unavailability of Pentium III gigahertz processors, and it's not just the continuing farce of [Rambus]; what's now in question is the very basis of [Intel] technology. Because logically, what [AMD] is doing shouldn't be possible&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
