  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not impose this suspension manually.&lt;/em&gt;  Use chat suspension instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To prevent spam, new accounts begin with an &quot;email suspension&quot; which prevents them from chatting in any room, but not from sending messages.  They will need to click on the link in their welcome email or visit [Verify your email address].  If the user has issues validating, visit their homenode [Infected Users|to see if they are infected].  If they are, they may be a repeat offender creating a new account.
