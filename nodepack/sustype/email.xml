  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not impose this suspension.&lt;/em&gt;  It is obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To prevent spam, new accounts used to be created with an &quot;email suspension&quot; which prevented them from chatting in any room or posting writeups, but not from sending messages. The suspension was lifted when they proved they had a valid email address. Since November 7, 2012 it has no longer been possible to log in to a new account at all without activating the account with a link sent by email, so this is no longer needed.
