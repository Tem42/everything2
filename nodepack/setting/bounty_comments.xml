    <value>I want to know everything about training a sheep dog (also known as working or herding dog), using a sheep or cow dog, on the farm, shearing time, in shows, basically a very, very detailed thing about every aspect of a sheepdog's life. If it is not everything, I'll frown on it. If it has everything, you'll probably get a ching and endless praise. </value>

    <value>Tallu was, as they say, &quot;mad, bad, and dangerous to know&quot;, but the existing w/u gives us no idea why. She had an interesting history, both because of her family, and as a performer. Make us proud, and not only will you get 300 GP, but a disc containing all her '[The Big Show]' broadcasts still existing. Aside from the kitsch value, it's a great listen into the last gasp of big network radio.</value>

    <value>The biggest badass of the British 17th Century...  England's Thomas Paine, only with a better moustache. A snotty, opinionated fiercely educated revolutionary who personally made life about as difficult for the Roundheads as anyone could hope. Imprisoned, unimprisoned, imprisoned again...  Makes Ben Franklin look like a royalist.  The man deserves a decent writeup.</value>

    <value>Why in the hell is there no writeup for the TV series? If you do a good job, you get a C! from me, and can request which original series Doctor Who story I write up next. I do not just want to hear about [Emma Peel], you must discuss all the main characters who worked with Steed (including boring old Keel). Try this site for starters: [http://theavengers.tv/forever/guide.htm]</value>

    <value>Spending time on research on a woman who stalks me in music stores called Shakira and I cannot figure out why she is doing this based on writeups that are existing there now and very worried. Help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A really informative writeup will get you a blessing and a C! from some of my elitist old guard friends. A writeup that helps me with the stalking problem will get you a computer transmitted photograph of me, Berhardt Goats, being kissed by two lesbians.</value>

    <value>Not looking for the band, looking for a commentary on the idea that boys are failing in schools, etc. and the counter argument it's because we're feminizing education. In short, there's arguments for and against it being because of a change in the nature of school and work, and another saying it's affirmative action. I'd like a female noder to examine these issues critically.</value>

    <value>The node is terribly subpar, with the first writeup as of the time of writing consisting of about 50% aggressive falsehood by volume. A good writeup that doesn't talk nonsense about unsubstantiated &#187;primordial mythologies&#171; will earn a ching, and I can egg you until I get tired of it.</value>
