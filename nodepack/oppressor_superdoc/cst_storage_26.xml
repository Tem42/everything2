&lt;br&gt;Hi dannye, I checked the CST inbox today and found your message. It looks like the [Poem from Lolita] was deleted. There&#8217;s no info as to why and it&#8217;s not in the nodeshell creators heaven. I&#8217;m guessing it was taken care of by someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

2007-10-07@14:49[ XWiz] says Hey Lometa - can you do me a favour and give me a second opinion. I was trawling through the daylogs and I found this one by [Vagary] under [May 12, 2002] - the one about seitan and plagiarism. Check out Sensei's node and about halfway down the article listed. They are the same, but Sensei has changed the odd word or two. I'm not sure whether it constitutes plagiarism or whether to just ignore it. Hence... your advice, please. :)
&lt;br&gt; Hi XWiz! Thanks for bringing this to my attention. sensei  once had a node called [The Everything Dishonest Scholarship Problem] which is long gone, but still he acknowledged that he too was guilty of some falsities. I have yet to find one though.  He had also published a number of translations from Japanese to English and well aware of copyrights. He was very clever with [seitan]. In the US, recipes enjoy [US Copyright for Recipes|unique latitude] in that lists of ingredients are not subject to copyright. Tossing out the list of ingredients and the sentences he wrote in his own words leaves a whopping 3% of the words borrowed from the website [Vagary] references. Since sensei was a cook we can&#8217;t say where he got his original text. It could be from this web site or he could have gotten it from his own copy of the cookbook. It&#8217;s [CST approved]. :)

It turns out it's a copy of 1918 White's Elements of Style (before there was a Strunk attached). It should probably have attribution added, in addition to a proper CST review, if possible.

Hello, Sahib! This write up was submitted to [Content_salvage] for copyright evaluation and passes with flying colors. If you would like to you may add the [CST Approved] tag. You may also want to add to the write up that the song is attributed to [Ernie Mayne] who first recorded it in 1926 which puts it in public domain.  &lt;/p&gt;

Hello Jurph , An ambitious translation and with a flavor of the Scandinavian influence.:) This was submitted to [Content_salvage] with the suggestion that it be [CST Approved]. Since it&#8217;s a translation by you, you of course, hold the copyright. You may add the link to your write up if you would like to.&lt;/p&gt;

By the Waters of Babylon by Kizor. He says it is in public domain.
&lt;br&gt;Hi there, I've been asked to review this for [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright compliance].  The wu mentions that the work is Public Domain, but it was first published in 1937, so I'm not clear on why it's PD.  Could you please explain?  
&lt;br&gt; 2007.06.18 at 22:29	Kizor says What I was acting on was, on reflection, tacit approval: By The Waters of Babylon has been undisturbed on Wikisource for two years now, categorized and monitored, and you know how hard those folks come down on copyrights. Wikisource explicitly forbids fair use. You know copyrights and E2 better than me, but looking at the link you gave and the external links from it I got the impression that to be in copyright, the story would've had to been renewed at the end of the original term of protection, 28 years, at which point Benet had been dead for a long time. (I wouldn't trust my own judgement on this, FYI.) If necessary, I can truncate the w/u to remove the story entirely and replace with a Wikisource link, but it'll be a pity, since I'm quite pleased with my experimental softlinking.
&lt;br&gt;Thanks for getting back to me.  I like the writeup, and the story itself, but based on what I've seem thus far I don't see why the story would be PD.  The WikiSource page is perplexing because they ARE very careful. I think I could give your wu a pass if we prepared a carefully worded citation indicating Wiki as the source.  Would you be okay with that?
&lt;br&gt;2007.06.19 at 17:34	Kizor says That would be utterly satisfactory. How would one be crafted? I'm not experienced with creating citations.
&lt;br&gt;I took the liberty of adding an appropriate note at the bottom of your wu.  If you're okay with that we're all done.  Cheers.

&lt;br&gt;This is generally attributed to EB White, but since it's widely published (e.g. Wikipedia), can probably be considered in the Public Domain.
&lt;br&gt;2007.06.15 at 19:58	Jack says I'm okay with it staying, but an attribution would be nice, I agree.
&lt;br&gt; Tis done.

I know I've done this enough times that I probably know when something is CST compliant, but ... I've just redone my [Great Lakes] article. Used about 100 words of a Gordon Lightfoot song (in a 1000 word writeup) ... So I thought I'd seek CST approval, because, you know, I'm the kind of person who is always seeking approval of one kind or another! *grin* thanks!
