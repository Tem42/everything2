&lt;br&gt;Hello pingouin, Unfortunately because if the [E2 copyright changes] this can no longer stay in the database. If you would like to update it and resubmit it you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material |FAQ] for suggestions and ideas.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Request (w/timestamp) &amp; Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello ehud, This is a very nice reactionary piece to Eliot&#8217;s work:) It&#8217;s been reviewed by the [CST_Group] and is compliant. If you would like to you can append this hardlink &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; .  There are a significant number of typos and this really needs to be run through a spell checker. You may also want to include that the quartets were first published separately between 1935 and 1942 in your write up for the purposes of meeting fair use.

&lt;br&gt;Hello Goldenboy26, Unfortunately the lyrics you have cited in this write up are 330 words and in order for it to meet fair use there can be no more than 250. You may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for some suggestions and ideas. If you have any questions I will be more than happy to assist. If I don&#8217;t hear from you by next [September 21,2005|Wednesday] I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t want to update it and it will be removed.
&lt;br&gt;After some clarifications about fair use I received the following msg from the user&quot; 2005.9.19@22:15 Goldenboy26 says Lometa my write up got cut while I was waiting for permission from the publisher.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt; I replied, &quot;That's okay. You can wait until you get the go-ahead from the copyright holder and repost it or resubmit it now so that it meets fair use and update it later with all the lyrics when you get permission.&quot;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Request (w/timestamp) &amp; Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;   2005.9.6 (1.1 hr) JohnnyGoodyear says OK, Jane, you ignorant slut! is pretty much cut and paste to start with, albeit from the noted fan site, but do we think these scripts are copyright?
&lt;br&gt;2005.9.9 (36.6 min) [riverrun] says &quot;Note that site (cited) is not affiliated with SNL. A script is the property of the person who wrote it until it's bought, at which point--in this case--it belongs to SNL, NBC, whomever.&quot; So these are clearly non-compliant.

&lt;br&gt;Hello Fuzzy and Blue, This write up has been submitted  to [Content_Salvage] for review. The write up under [Grateful Dead lyrics] gives E2 permission to host them as long as Ice Nine Publishing is credited. I am assuming that their liberal copyright policy includes linear notes.  [Blues for Allah] has a nice example. Please let me know when you&#8217;ve added the credit and I&#8217;ll give you the okay dokey for a CST tag.
&lt;br&gt;2005.9.2@6:54 [fuzzy and blue] says I killed [Iko Iko] myself; perhaps someday I will repost with appropriate permissions but since I don't know when that someday is I figure it's best not to risk getting e2 in trouble.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Request (w/timestamp) &amp; Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;2005.8.23@23:46 [Junkill] says Hey copyright folks: I am thrilled, the copyright holder of a song has written me back. She asks several questions, most of which I can answer, two which left me baffled. 1) &quot;any security features in place to protect copyrighted material posted on the site&quot; .. 2) &quot;amount of time lyrics would be available on the site&quot; which is, I suppose, indefinitely ... I want to do this right, and it is exciting to me that they wrote back. Can you help?

&lt;p&gt;What a thrill! I&#8217;m not sure what the copyright holder means by security features. You may want to write her back and ask for more details. Because you have permission the amount of time they would be available would be up to you as the author of the write up as well as the original copyright holder.  For example if she says the lyrics can be available for 4 weeks then you could post them here and then per your agreement make a deletion request. 

&lt;p&gt;One way to work around these issues would be to do a little interview with her about the background of the song. As long as your original work exceeds two thirds of the lyrics posted then your write up can stay for as long as you want it to under the guidelines of [fair use]. For more specifics you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]. When you are ready to subit the write up message [Content_Salvage] again and request a [CST Approved] tag. &#8211;[Lometa|lo].

&lt;br&gt;Hello  Cooz, Because of the [E2 copyright changes] there has to have some sort of verification that the information copied and pasted into the database meets the requirements discussed in the  [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] . There are several suggestions to consider such as contacting the author and asking for permission or adding more original content to meet fair use. If you have any questions I&#8217;d be more than happy to help. If I don&#8217;t hear from you by next [August 10|Wednesdy] I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t want to keep the write up and it will be removed. 
&lt;br&gt;Hello again Cooz, It&#8217;s been over a week since this was reported to the [Content-Salvage] team. Unfortunately we can&#8217;t leave possible copyrighted material in the database indefinitely. If you would like to update and resubmit this write up and have any questions please feel free to msg me or [GrouchyOldMan].

&lt;br&gt;/msg [Pseudo_Intellectual] Re. [End of the World]: Okay, I took the bait and reviewed this one as well.  First off, I want you to know that I dig this poem! I get what you are saying, and I like the way that you're saying it.  Upvote for sure.  However, I'm not sure it's copyright compliant.  Assuming that there's no Public Domain content in there, and that all the indented and italicized bits are quoted, I'm seeing 43% quoted, higher than the [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright policy] threshold for fair use. Without knowing the specific source for each quote, I can't say one way or another whether it's compliant or not.  How would you like to proceed?
&lt;BR&gt;2005.07.12 at 05:49	[Pseudo_Intellectual] says You may have noticed I haven't been around much lately; still, in the face of crisis, I've done a bit of analysis on End of the World and now after crunching the following numbers you can tell me precisely which limb needs to be amputated for the patient to survive 8)

&lt;br&gt; 
Hello Ikura, Unfortunately there is not enough original content in this write up to meet fair use. As it stands now the quoted piece is 44% and to be copyright compliant it cannot exceed 10%. You may want to read through [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]for suggestions and ideas. If you have any questions I would be more than happy to help.  If I don&#8217;t hear from you by next [July 9, 2005|Sunday] I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t want to keep it and it will be removed.
&lt;p&gt;2005.7.2@23:47 [Ikura] says [Nymphet] - I think you're misreading the 10% standard, that's supposed to be no more than 10% of the quoted work, and I can assure you that Lolita is more than ten times as long as that excerpt.
&lt;br&gt; You&#8217;re right! It still requires more content  to be copyright compliant because the FAQ says, &#8220;in all cases, your writeup must be 2/3 original material .&#8220;   As it is now the quoted content is 44%.
&lt;p&gt; 2005.7.3@2:11 [Ikura] says Okay, then. I added some stuff on etymology that should satisfy that desire, too. As a matter of curiosity, exactly how are pipelinks counted w/r/t calculating percentages of content?
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Ikura. It looks good at 32%:) If you would like to you may append this hardlink &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; . At this time the [Content_Salvage] team does not count pipe links as a part of the total word count. [GouchyOldMan] would be the best person to ask.

You may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for some suggestions and ideas. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Please let me know what you decide. I&#8217;ll check back in 24 hours. If nothings changed it will have to be removed.

&lt;p&gt;Thank you! In your sources you may want to explicate that you are the author of the episode guide in the write up since there are a lot of [http://tinyurl.com/aygwp|web sites] claiming copyright. You may also want to append this hard link &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; . :)

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, this writeup has come up for copyright review.  Your translation is lovely, but to comply with the [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright policy] it needs a bit more original copy.  Let's discuss.
