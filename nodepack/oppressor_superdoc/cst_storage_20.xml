2006-02-02@21:55 [Walte]r says As you may have noticed I'm going through the work of [spacklequeen] and there's a lot... a LOT... of Caroliner lyrics which say &quot;Noded with permission&quot; and &quot;copyright 1883&quot; which seem to me like conveniently unverifiable statements.
&lt;br&gt; 2006-02-13@12:55 [XWiz] says I've gone through [spacklequeen] 's nodes. The majority of the lyrics say they're copyright compliant. I've not removed any of the very low reputation ones, and I've held my hand on the editing front having realised it's not my place to change 'yr' 'your', even if it does annoy me. :) I also started to replace the '&amp;' with '&amp;' for html compliance and then realised I wasn't sure if there was any point or if it was even my business to. I did msg spacklequeen on each writeup I edited. You'll have  noticed my question about Duane Dibbley 's account; if you've any advice or info to offer on spackle or dibbley I'd be delighted to hear it. Thanks!

&lt;br&gt;Hello [Walter], [Xwiz] and I did a node audit on spaklequeen&#8217;s account and have left the ones that say that lyrics were used with permission because it is E2&#8217;s policy in the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material |FAQ] at this time.  Everything looks up to snuff and if you find more or have questions about what remains please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask. Thank you! ([lometa|lo])
&lt;br&gt;I see here that you comment that you sent for permission to node lyrics and the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material |FAQ] at this time says we have to accept the noders word. I was wondering if you ever heard from them? ([lometa|lo] to spacklequeen re her last [January 31, 2001|day log])
&lt;br&gt;Hey there we&#8217;ve got a problem going on with [spacklequeen]&#8217;s account. She has a large number of lyrics that say they are noded with permission yet her last [January 31, 2001|day log] notes that she had not heard from one band. [Walter], [Xwiz] and I have all audited her account. I&#8217;m going to hand off the decision about what to do to you. There will be an evaluation in [CST_Chat] very soon. If you would be so kind to add your comments to it I would really appreciate it. ([lometa|lo] to [GrouchyOldMan|GOM])
&lt;br&gt;2006-03-12@12:56 [spacklequeen] says thanks for all the messages, but i can not give more than 33%. &quot;copyright&quot; isn't in my dictionary. I'm in the process of having all my nodes killed. ..... .. cheers.

E2 is so lacking in lyrics and it would be a shame to loose all of the hard work you&#8217;ve contributed.

&lt;br&gt;Hello waverider37, Unfortunately because of copyrights E2 cannot keep copyrighted lyrics in its database unless they meet [fair use]. At this time the quoted lyrics are 48% of the write up and the minimum standard is 33%. Adding more original content about the song or show can bring it up to the standards. I will be more than happy to help. Please let me know what you would like to do by next [February 17,2006|Friday]. If I don&#8217;t hear from you by then I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t want to update it and it will be removed. Kind regards.
&lt;br&gt;2006.02.11 at 08:50 [waverider37] says I never knew about that. Unfortunately I will not have much time to do anything about it before Friday, is it possible to give me an extension?
&lt;br&gt;Sure! Can you give me a time frame?

&lt;br&gt;2006.02.12 at 04:21 [waverider37] says I should have it done by next weekend... Give me until Monday, UTC.	 
&lt;br&gt;2006.02.12 at 04:46 [waverider37] says Actually, never mind. I found time. Is that enough to be acceptable?	 
	
&lt;br&gt;ah geez it&#8217;s right at 35%. Two or three sentences are all that&#8217;s needed. How about adding a small blurb about which season it appeared in and who the writer is. Here&#8217;s a [http://tinyurl.com/7lac5 |web site] (Wiki) with some info about that.	

&lt;br&gt;2006-02-12@5:44 [waverider37] says I can handle two or three. Be done in a jiffy.
&lt;br&gt;Hooray! It&#8217;s at 30% Congratulations! You may append this hardlink &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; . I knew you could do it!

&lt;br&gt; Hi spacklequeen, I hope you come back some day and add a few words to this and resubmit it. The quoted content it 34% just barely above what the cut off is.  Just a matter of a few sentences. I like the song and am sorry to see it go.

&lt;br&gt;Hi spacklequeen, This one is really close. To meet [fair use] the quoted content cannot exceed 33%. As it is now it&#8217;s 38% so if you would like to add a few more sentences put it on your scrach pad and ask someone from [Content_Salvage] to review it please do.

&lt;br&gt; Hi again borgo. The lyric count for this write up is 308 and the cut off is 250.  What would you like to do?
&lt;br&gt;2006-01-28@17:00 borgo says I'l like to change copyright law but since that seems out of the realm of possibility, I'll re-work in the next day or so and get back to you - is that ok?&lt;br&gt; Sure' nuff. Let me know when it's ready and I'll be happy to review it agains:)
&lt;br&gt;Lo to borgo --&quot;Any idea when you'll have yhis updated?&quot; (02/10/2006)
&lt;br&gt;[borgo] says re [Ready Or Not] dang, it slipped my mind - mebbe in the next day or two or three -if I can't come up with something I'll just kill it...
&lt;br&gt; okay:) Lemme know what you decide so I can close out the CST evaluation on it.

&lt;br&gt;2006-02-16@16:09 [borgo] says re [Ready or Not] - I killed it - couldn't make coherent without the entire song - oh well...
&lt;br&gt;Okay thanks! One idea might be to write and ask permission to post all the lyrics within the context of the write up. A lot of times they are more than happy to let writers do that.

It&#8217;s nukeable as-is, but I'd much rather see it fleshed out... but I know the author &amp; he's none too active these days. Anyway at the very least, some of those linked poems are surely in violation. Pip pip
&lt;br&gt;Hello Quizro, Unfortunately all the poems that are hardlinked in this write up went by the wayside during the [E2 copyright changes]. If you would like to update it and resubmit it with some original content E2 sure would be all the better for it. 
&lt;br&gt; Hi Jessica, After checking all the links all of the poems in [archy and mehitabel] had already been removed from the database. I deleted [Quizo]s and encouraged him to update it.

The original poem (1916ish) is out of copyright, but this translation is uncredited and undated and to be found in various other places on the web.
&lt;br&gt;Hello Garryn, Unfortunately the translation of this poem was done by author Jon Silkin and fist published in his book &#8220;The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry: Revised Edition.&#8221; Oftentimes a poem will be in public domain in its original language, however the translators of the poem create their own copyright. If you would like to update this and resubmit it you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material].

&lt;br&gt;[GlowingFish|Mutant Pescado] sez: 2006-04-21 (59.8 min) Glowing Fish says Oh, is that still there? Did you count the lyrics that are in the public domain? How many of the lyrics are in the public domain? Did you count the words in the softlinks as part of the word total? And, did you count the words after I added a paragraph this morning? And, do you realize that I like it when I can stop feeling bad about what happens to the culture of, mmm, you don't have words. Have fun.
&lt;br&gt;[GrouchyOldMan|VisiblyAgingAndIrritable] responds: /msg Glowing_Fish Words? I have lots of words. For example supercilious is a word that comes to mind when I've put in the time to try and address a problem and I get a [Know where you are, don't be a fool|foolish] loopy answer. Your wu sleeps with the [glowing|fishes].
&lt;br&gt; Luminous Minnow sez: 2006-04-21 (2.7 min) Glowing Fish says I did add another paragraph in there. I don't have a calculator. It was a silly writeup, anyway. But...ah, well. No time now.

Sorry to write to you personally, rather than the CST group, but I could not remember which page to go to and I have to bolt off for work. Could you, or someone in CST, look over my daylog [April 3, 2006] (place) ... it should be no problem, it  is about 750 words, and I think about 125 are from a Jill Sobule song (I got tired of the big fight that was going on between Johnny, Halspal and Excalibre so I decided to put my feelings down in words).

&lt;br&gt;Hello twic, Just a note to let you know that [The Custodian]&#8217;s write up is being removed because of the [E2 copyright changes]. This will leave the readers that come across this write up in the future wondering about its content and the downvotes will accumulate over time. To off set the down voting one idea would be to update it by expanding on the explication you have begun about the lyrics under [fair use]. If you are interested in doing that there are some guidelines in the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]. There are many examples of this in the database. One noder that does an excellent job on lyrics and storytelling in [borgo]. Another noder who does exceedingly well is [dannye]. You may want to read through several of their write ups to get a feel for it and come up with something completely novel on your own. 

&lt;p&gt;If you would like a fresh start there is always the option to remove the write up with a [E2 Nuke Request|deletion request].  It&#8217;s tough learning the ropes here and I encourage you to hang in there. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for help from anyone with an @ or $ by their names and a shout out to the cat box will always lead to support from most of the users. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me!

&lt;br&gt;Hello CthulhuFhtagn, Unfortunately since the [E2 copyright changes] we have to remove any questionable content.

White and a cursory effort to find an email address has failed even though there is one web site claiming that the info has been reprinted with permission. I&#8217;m sorry to say that [http://tinyurl.com/jmywq |Google groups] intimate that he has since suffered serious brain damage suggesting the reason for the lack of any current contact information and without permission to reprint cannot keep the content in the database.

&lt;br&gt;Okay thanks! After skimming through a few of the write ups [AV-8B Harrier], [Fuel cell], [Curtiss P-40 Warhawk] and [Turbo] then Googling for near plagiarism and checking the listed sources, I can find information from the websites where the content is accurate and rewritten in the noder&#8217;s own words. Is there a write up in particular that seems paraphrased?
&lt;br&gt;Hang on. I reread your original message and began looking at the more recent write-ups. There are two write ups that are questionable  [Preventive Maintenance] (plagiarized) and [frame of reference] (needs quotation marks and a reference for the opening line or it needs to be rewritten in the noder&#8217;s own words) I&#8217;ve got to go and will work more on this tomorrow. If there are any that I have missed please give me a heads up!

If I don&#8217;t hear from you by next [April 24, 2006|Monday], I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t wish to update it and it will be removed.
&lt;br&gt;Removed because of the [E2 copyright changes].</doctext>
