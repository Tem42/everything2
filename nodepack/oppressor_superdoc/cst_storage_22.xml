&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Request (w/timestamp) &amp; Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; 2006-08-01@21:16 jessicapierce says hey there - very minor concern with mocktail - a couple of the recipes he includes are taken word-for-word from the sources he cites, but he doesn't make it clear that he's quoting their wording. I hate to be the voice of anything but total encouragement, as this user's been kind enough to knock out 4 or 5 of my scratchpadded list items - would you mind asking him to clear this up?
&lt;br&gt;Hello drinkypoo, This write up was submitted to [Content_Salvage] for review and passes with flying colors. One suggestion I would like to make is to put the recipe directions taken from the referenced sources in quotations. If you would like to you can add the [CST Approved] tag. :)

&lt;br&gt;Very cooperative when asked to cite content with quotes. Took it one step further with footnotes.

He won't reply to my msges. The manual is surely out of copyright, and the translation is his own, so there's no issues with legality - I just thing adding the date would put it all in context, but lie I say, he won't reply. Will you try? pleases, sugar on top etc.
&lt;br&gt;Hi there.  This is a really excellent addition, thanks. I'm linking it from [White Tea] too.  I've been asked to review your writeup for [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright compliance], and I hope to offer you the [CST Approved] tag, but I have a question.  Can you please contact me?
&lt;br&gt; 2006-08-03 (6.9 hr) dharbigt says Ok, I'm contacting you.
&lt;br&gt;/msg dharbigt Thanks, can you provide any additional details on the original document you are citing?  When was it written?  Are you confident that it is not under copyright protection?  I'm not doubting you, just looking for some assurance so that I can offer you the [CST Approved] tag to add to your writeup.
&lt;br&gt; 2006-08-18 (3 hr) dharbigt says The document was given to me personally by the tea store manager; it's only for empoloyees and so it's not a published work, per se. I'm positive there's no copyright protection on it and I've been given permission to do whatever I like with the translation.
&lt;br&gt;Thank you for the clarification, and for sharing your work with E2.  You may add the [CST Approved] tag to your writeup if you'd like.  Cheers.

&lt;br&gt;Hi waverider37, Sure you can get a [CST approved] tag! And once it’s modified, be sure to let the editor know.  It’s a good idea to have the tag in there so others will recognize that it’s copyright compliant. :) This write up passes with flying colors and if you would like to you can add the [CST approved] tag.

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, Bad news I'm afraid.  This writeup doesn't appear to be compliant with the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 Copyright Policy] under the [Fair Use] rules. The Semisonic quote is fine, but the Cohen quote needs to be cut down to 250 words or less. I like the writeup and hope you can take the time to revise it for compliance.  Otherwise it's gotta go.
&lt;br&gt; 2006-08-02 (40 min) The Custodian says re: Closing Time: Snipped.
&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the quick response.  I'm still finding 320 words quoted from the LC song, our policy is 250 max.  Can you drop another couple of verses without wrecking it?
&lt;br&gt; 2006.08.02 at 16:28	The Custodian says OK, I think I got it :-)

&lt;br&gt;Hello too_fast_to_live,   Unfortunately E2 cannot keep copyrighted or non-original work in the database. In order to meet fair use Cited material that is copyrighted non-fiction cannot exceed 10% of work or 1000 words, whichever is less. If the work is less than 1000 words then cited material must not exceed 10% of work. The way the write up is presented at this time the cited material is 390 words which is well within fair use. The problem is that the quotation from the website is 54 % of the write up. One way to fix this would to be to add more original content and cite a quote from another source. For more suggestions and ideas you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]. If you have any questions please don’t I’d be happy to help! If I don’t hear from you by Thursday, July 20th I’ll assume you don’t want to update this and it will be removed. 
&lt;p&gt;Hello [too_fast_to_live], Thank you for taking the time to update [Cerulean Butterfly]. =) Readers may want to read what’s at the website and you may want to add the URL in brackets with a pipeline [www.ceruleanbutterfly.com/|Cerulean Butterfly]. That way they can click on it and it will take them to a page with the link to follow. Have a great day!

&lt;br&gt;Hello originalzin, Unfortunately lyrics cannot exceed [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|250 words]. As the write up is now, it’s at 278 words. I’ve had to cut back on a few of mine and it’s hard to decide what to remove. One idea might be, after the first chorus, to replace the choruses with the word “chorus” that may possibly get the write up within the requirements. Let me know what you decide and if you have any questions please free to ask me or [GrouchyOldMan]. (I’ll be out of town until next Tuesday.) We’ll be happy to help!

&lt;br&gt; Hi there.  I've been asked to review this for [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright compliance]. If I understand your note, you've paraphrased Hugo's work which is, itself, in the [Public Domain]. Is that about right?  How much is a direct quote?
&lt;br&gt; 2006-07-16 (4.1 hr) Antithesys says Love of a damned man is a combination of two translations, Isabel Hapgood's and Alban Krailsheimer's. Hugo's work and both translations are in the public domain. For copyright purposes, it would be entirely a direct quote. I have merely left out certain dialogue.

Unfortunately it doesn’t meet the standards for copyright compliance because 72% of the content has been taken from the [http://501tag.com/Forum/index.php?act=announce&amp;f=29&amp;id=2|Terror Australis Garrison] website. There are several options to choose from. One would be to ask the writer of the Club Charter for permission to republish it here on E2 and cite them as your source and we can reevaluate it for a [CST approved] tag. Another one would be to rewrite parts of the charter in your own words. The key is to make sure that the cited material doesn’t exceed 10% of work or 1000 words, whichever is less.
There is more information in the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|FAQ] and if you have any questions I’d be happy to help! Please let me know what you decide to do by next [July 12, 2006|Wednesday]. If I haven’t heard from you by then, Ill assume you don’t want to keep it and it will be removed.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask me or anyone on the editorial team.

Not sure though. 
&lt;br&gt;Hi there, I've been asked to review this one for compliance with the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 Copyright Policy]. It looks like the same receipe appears on www.cs.unc.edu under the name of Chris Silker. Is that you, or do you have Silker's permission to repost it on E2?
&lt;br&gt; 2006-10-07 (43.7 min) Tem42 says The original Allergy safe recipes node was moved to Restricted and Special Diet Recipes; the copyright information is there at the bottom of the WU. I have it as copyrighted to Eileen Kupstas Soo (1997-98); I don't know who has the original copyright.
&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the quick response.  Would you mind adding the copyright notice to the WU so it's clear that it's reproduced here with permission.  Once that's done you can also add the [CST Approved] tag to your wu if you wish.
&lt;br&gt; Errr, I guess we should add the notice to all the receipes from that same source. I'll be glad to help if you'd like...
&lt;br&gt; 2006.10.07 at 23:31	Tem42 says Unexpected computer time! It'a all done. Thanks for your help with all of this. I'll try to be more wary of copyrights in the future.

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, Bad news I'm afraid.  This writeup didn't appear to be compliant with the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 Copyright Policy]. The problem was that the material quoted must be less than 33% of your writeup, yours was at 38%.  Since you haven't been around E2 much lately, I've taken the liberty of bringing your writeup into compliance by removing the last quote.  If you'd prefer another solution, or would like the writeup removed instead please let me know.

I have no idea of the rules of that, so though I’d turn it over to you guys. Also, if these Latin wus of his do turn out to be kosher noding material, could you *please* urge him to include the English version as well? His translation notes are quite detailed, and I'm sure each wu would end up being at least 2/3 original content - but without the English translation, which is, after all, *policy*, I just don't see the point of having the Latin version here. I've mentioned this to him but it isn't getting through, &amp; maybe he needs to hear it from more than one editor. Help?
&lt;br&gt;Hello Major General Panic, This write up has been submitted to [Content_Salvage] for review and passes with flying colors. If you would like to you can add the [CST approved] tag. Some editorial suggestions. For better voting mileage you may want to add some of the lyrics that are being translated here and a small snippet of an explanation since out of context of the metanode [Ascensus Casusque Sigii Sidorum et Aranearum Martis] the translations and notes are extemporaneous explications of unknown lyrics and most readers would find it hard to understand what the write up is about. Lyrics can be up to 250 words from the song and one third of the total write up word count. It’s more that likely that they would fall well within the requirements of the guidelines in the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|FAQ].  If you would like to update this with the suggestion I would be more than happy to reevaluate it for you.
&lt;br&gt;2006-09-05@15:22 [Major General Panic] says I'd love to update the Ziggy Stardust writeups with information about the original music in addition to the Latin bits; in fact, I've been wanting to do it for a while. Once I find some spare time again, I'll get to work!

&lt;br&gt;Hi Jessica, re [Tanita Tikaram] I can’t find any reliable references at the Library of Congress copyright website or legal opinions about [Press Release]s, our own node leaves out any relevant information about their status in the publication world and the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|FAQ] has no stance delineated on this particular topic.
&lt;p&gt;One the web, all of the discussions of press releases consider them to be ‘n the public domain based on the logic that the purpose is to disseminate the information contained within to the widest possible audience. One can take the information in the press release, rewrite or simply copy it and repackage it - and have a copyrighted publication. The value received by the original publisher of the news release is he does not have to purchase the media space or air time to have his product information published or broadcast by other media. The price paid with a press release is that the disseminator does not control who publishes the information or how or when. If he wants that power he can purchase publication space or air time and run a copyrighted ad or commercial.’ (Paraphrased from Google groups [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.video.desktop/browse_thread/thread/3c3c729fafb923d0/7c1caa1a653b4c57?lnk=st&amp;q=%22press+release%22+%22public+domain%22+copyright&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#7c1caa1a653b4c57|New Canon DV Cams - Press Release-copyright violation] ) (external link) 
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to find any arguments for press releases being under copyright because, as most commentaries noted, it would be counter productive to the purpose of releasing information for wide spread distribution.  
&lt;p&gt;I’m giving this a pass for now and posting a CE discussion about including this question in the copyright FAQ. It would be great if it would be updated to include whatever the editorial consensus would be about press releases on E2 because it’s very time consuming to research this topic when it comes up as most of us can’t remember. 
&lt;br&gt;Hello iain, Unfortunately because of the current editorial standards we can no longer keep writes ups that are mostly press releases in the database. If you would like to update this and resubmit it you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for some suggestions and ideas.

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, Bad news I'm afraid.  This writeup doesn't appear to be compliant with the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 Copyright Policy]. If you'd like to update it for compliance and repost, I'd be glad to assist.

But you see, it isn't really mine. It was originally an anonymous post on slashdot. I copied it here, during our freewheeling days, and then forgot about it. But, I wonder what the copywrite status on an anonymous slashdot post is. Legally and morally, is that plagiarism? I consider it to be somewhat like a very long graffiti slogan, of unknown orgin. What do you think?	 
&lt;br&gt;Hi there, Good news, I'm tentatively giving it a pass under Public Domain on the theory that anonymous postings on public websites are not protected by copyright law. Please feel free to add the [CST Approved] tag if you like.
