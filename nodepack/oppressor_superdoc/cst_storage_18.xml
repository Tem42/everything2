&lt;br&gt;Hello nocodeforparanoia, Unfortunately  since the [E2 copyright changes] copyrighted work can no longer be kept in the database. As it stands now the quoted part is 92 % of the write up and to meet fair use it can only be 33%. One suggestion would be to consider adding more original content so the write up meets [fair use]. There is more about copyright at [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]. Please let me know what you would like to do.
&lt;br&gt; 2005.10.23@7:08 [nocodeforparanoia] says ...and thank you. hmm... Galadriel.... don't even remember noding that. I'll see what I can find on it. if I can't find anything good on it, i'll nuke request it. thank you for having the rare gift of keeping folks on their toes and doing it in a compassionate way!
&lt;br&gt;Hey there, I&#8217;ll check back next [October 29, 2005|Saturady] to see if [Galadriel] has been updated. If not it has to  be removed so we don&#8217;t get in trouble. It can always be updated and resubmitted when you feel ready to:)
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.29@6:14 [nocodeforparanoia] says re [Galadriel]: it seems I haven't had the time to do anything with this in a week. Go ahead and kill it. If I have time for it in the future, I'll resubmit. Thanks.

If that's true, my writeup N.W.O. needs to die. I don't know if this is the right way to go about this, I haven't been updating in a year or two and forgot how everything works.
&lt;br&gt;Welcome back! Let me take a look. 
  &lt;br&gt;2005.10.25@15:07 skweejeepusher says I probably won't be checking my inbox but i'm just giving you a heads up.


&lt;br&gt;It&#8217;s a close call. If you can add about three or four sentences to it, it can stay in the database. Like maybe when it was released and who composed the lyrics.

&lt;br&gt;No reply. Write up removed at user&#8217;s request.

As it stands now the quoted part is 53 % of the write up and the cut off is 33%.

&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:46 TheBooBooKitty says Hi Lometa. I never even thought of that. It was an old node. I had killed, then updated and resumbitted. I'll go over them all and get them down to 33 percent.
&lt;br&gt;Ah I see now. There are nine of them. Here are their titles, [Keystone Kapers], [Kung Fu Master], [Robot Tank], [H.e.r.o.],[ skiing], [Sky Jinks],[ SeaQuest],[ Yars' Revenge], and [The Dreadnaught Factor].  Let&#8217;s give it until next [October 19,2005|Wednesday] since there are so many. Does that sound okay? 
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:55 TheBooBooKitty says Pretty sure I got robot tank under compliance now. My word counter has it at 34 percent quote now. I'll check my other recent ones tommorrow, and I start checking the old ones after that.
&lt;br&gt;I have 36 % it has to be 33% or less. Use the word count in the header if you have it turned on. For some reason it gives you a few more words and works to your advantage. Let me know when you're ready and I'll evaluate them again:)
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:57 TheBooBooKitty says I'll trim all those tommorrow. I am more worried about the 50 or 100 of them from 4 years ago. I'll have to check all my cartridge nodes one by one, which will take longer.
&lt;br&gt;Okay, it would be best to take care of the new ones first or he editors may nuke them after a while. When you have the older ones ready message the titles with a link to [Content_Salvage] and we will go through them for [CST Approved|CST approval]. I hear ya, I had to go through hundreds of poems during the [e2 copyright changes] and check them for compliance then get them reviewed by the Content Salvage team. 
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@15:02 TheBooBooKitty says I am just going to cut the programmers tips thing down to one paragraph in each node so it ceases to be a problem at all.
 
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@15:06 TheBooBooKitty says Oh, and you can go ahead an kill Yar's Revenge there isn't a thing I can do with that one, the whole concept is that it was the transcipt of a terrible commerical song. I can't cut it down, and anything I added would be pure filler.
&lt;br&gt;Okay. I'm so sorry all this hard work.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Request (w/timestamp) &amp; Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey there! Bad news. This doesn&#8217;t pass muster for copyright compliance. As it stands now the quoted part is 53 % of the write up and the cut off is 33%. A couple of suggestion would be to consider adding more original content or reducing the quote or a combination of both. There is more about copyright at [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material]. If I don&#8217;t hear from you by [October 15,2005|Saturday], I&#8217;ll assume you don&#8217;t want to update it at this time and remove it. 
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:46 TheBooBooKitty says Hi Lometa. I never even thought of that. It was an old node. I had killed, then updated and resumbitted. I'll go over them all and get them down to 33 percent.
&lt;br&gt;Ah I see now. There are nine of them. Here are their titles, [Keystone Kapers], [Kung Fu Master], [Robot Tank], [H.e.r.o.],[ skiing], [Sky Jinks],[ SeaQuest],[ Yars' Revenge], and [The Dreadnaught Factor].  Let&#8217;s give it until next [October 19,2005|Wednesday] since there are so many. Does that sound okay? 
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:55 TheBooBooKitty says Pretty sure I got robot tank under compliance now. My word counter has it at 34 percent quote now. I'll check my other recent ones tommorrow, and I start checking the old ones after that.
&lt;br&gt;I have 36 % it has to be 33% or less. Use the word count in the header if you have it turned on. For some reason it gives you a few more words and works to your advantage. Let me know when you're ready and I'll evaluate them again:)
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@14:57 TheBooBooKitty says I'll trim all those tommorrow. I am more worried about the 50 or 100 of them from 4 years ago. I'll have to check all my cartridge nodes one by one, which will take longer.
&lt;br&gt;Okay, it would be best to take care of the new ones first or he editors may nuke them after a while. When you have the older ones ready message the titles with a link to [Content_Salvage] and we will go through them for [CST Approved|CST approval]. I hear ya, I had to go through hundreds of poems during the [e2 copyright changes] and check them for compliance then get them reviewed by the Content Salvage team.
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@15:02 TheBooBooKitty says I am just going to cut the programmers tips thing down to one paragraph in each node so it ceases to be a problem at all.
 &lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@15:06 TheBooBooKitty says Oh, and you can go ahead an kill Yar's Revenge there isn't a thing I can do with that one, the whole concept is that it was the transcipt of a terrible commerical song. I can't cut it down, and anything I added would be pure filler.
&lt;br&gt;Okay. I'm so sorry all this hard work.
&lt;br&gt;2005.10.12@15:10 TheBooBooKitty says All the recent ones should be fine now.
&lt;br&gt;This has been reviewed and is compliant. If you would like to you can append this hardlink &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; .
