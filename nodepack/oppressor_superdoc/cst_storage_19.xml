2006.1.24@22:35 [jessicapierce] says Seems like I remember guitar tabs being ok, right? But I&#146;m not real clear on how they skirt the lyrics issue... i.e. [unsatisfied].
&lt;br&gt;Hello Tlachtga,  Paul Westerberg  owns the copyrights to his guitar tablature and lyrics. Unfortunately E2 cannot keep work under copyright in its database. If you would like to update this so it meets [fair use] you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for some suggestions and ideas. If you have any questions I would be more than happy to help you.  Please let me know what you plan to do by Wednesday, February 1 ,2006. If I don't hear from you by then I'll assume you don't want to update and it will be removed. Kindest regards.

&lt;br&gt;Hello lolaleigh,  Unfortunately this write up does not meet the E2 standards for copyright compliance. Lyrics are limited to 250 per song. At this time the lyric word count is 357. Additionally cited material cannot exceed 33% of the original content. At this time the cited material is 43% of the original work. Cutting down on the lyrics to meet fair use might take care of the cited material percentage. If you would like more information on how to node lyrics, you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for further suggestions and ideas. Please let me know what you plan to do by Wednesday, February 1,2006. If I don't hear from you by then I'll assume you don't want to update and it will be removed. Kindest regards.

I have a writeup, currently on my scratchpad, entitled &quot;Everything Stops for Tea&quot; ... it uses a few stanzas from an obscure old 1930s musical movie, interspersed with essay and fun facts (Borgo-style)...I count 1,238 words (it's not final, but won't be much shorter than that), 214 of which are from the song. So, can I have a CST Approved tag for this bit of fluff?

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, I've been asked to review this work for  [E2 Copyright Changes|E2 copyright compliance] and I'm wondering what the source was for the translation?  
&lt;br&gt;2006.1.12 (29 min) brainwave says re Catullus: As it turns out you were quite right to be concerned about copyright. The translation is (c) 1995, Richard Bullington-McGuire. I have added attribution and written him asking for permission to republish it on e2. I will pass on his response or if you feel more comfortable nuke away. I am a 99.9% retired noder anyway : )
&lt;br&gt; /msg brainwave Thanks for the quick response.  I'd be delighted if Bullington-McGuire agreed, so why don't we give it a week or so to see.  If not, I'll remove it.  Okay? 
&lt;br&gt;2006.1.12 (16.7 hr) brainwave says I just got a response. He is a nice guy and has placed the translation under an Attribution+Noncommercial CC licence.  see his website http://www.obscure.org/obscene-latin/catullus-42.html
&lt;br&gt;Not to put to fine a point on it but, Far Fuckin Out! Please add the info to your wu and add the CST Approved tag. Good Job! :-)

&lt;br&gt; Hi there! According to the [http://www.seixon.com/blog/archives/2005/09/galloway_vs_hit.html|web site] cited as the source of this transcript in this write up, it&#146;s under copyright. If you are interested in updating and resubmitting it so that it is copyright compliant you may want to read through the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material] for some suggestions and ideas. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I&#146;ll be more than happy to assist.
&lt;p&gt;2005.12.29@7:40 [Mardy] says I have provided about half of the transcript - this should be fair use for the public domain. 

&lt;p&gt;(Lometa says) The [http://www.seixon.com/blog/archives/2005/09/galloway_vs_hit.html|source] you cite states explicitly &#147;TRANSCRIPT: This is a SEIXON EXCLUSIVE, must credit and must link!! COPYRIGHT &#169; 2005 SEIXON ALL RIGHTS RESERVED&#148; Even though it&#146;s speech made over the airwaves the transcript is still the work product of the host and that's why it&#146;s copyrightable. 

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways to work around this is to write the author of the blog and ask permission to reprint it here on E2. I think it would be a wonderful addition to the database.  Here are a couple of [All-purpose, handy-dandy Copyright Release/Permission Request Form|request forms] that other noders have found useful. 
&lt;p&gt; Another way would be to make the write up meet the definition of fair use according to the rules established in the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 FAQ].  Please read under the subheading,  &#147;Q. So can I use copyrighted material in my writeups?&#148;

&lt;p&gt;I know copyright is very confusing that&#146;s why we offer the services of a copyright team here. Let me know what you decide to do and if you have questions please feel free to ask:)

&lt;br&gt;Hello blowdart, Unfortunately since the [E2 copyright changes] we can no longer keep copyrighted work in the database.

&lt;br&gt;Hello again [Angry Safer], The [http://www.beerchurch.com/index.html|home page] for the source cited for this translation notes that &#147;all material&#148; is under copyright.

&lt;br&gt;Hi there, Bad news I'm afraid.  This writeup doesn't appear to be compliant with the [E2 FAQ: Copyrighted Material|E2 Copyright Policy]. For fair use compliance the quote should be less than 250 words total and 33% or less of the total wordcount.  If you'd like to add more original content to bring it into compliance and repost, I'd be glad to assist you.

&lt;br&gt;2006-02-16@23:35 [Walter] says Don't know if this is exactly your dept. - but [The Yellow Wallpaper] (public domain short story) is broken up into two nodes, unnecessarily. (See [The Yellow Wallpaper - Part 2].)
&lt;br&gt; Hello [blaaf], this write up and it&#146;s companion piece has been submitted to the [CST_Group] and is compliant. You may append this hardlink &amp;#91;CST Approved&amp;#93; . Thank you!
&lt;br&gt;Hello Walter, To answer your question about [The Yellow Wallpaper] and why it&#146;s in two nodes. Oftentimes noders can choose to post in two nodes because putting a long short story in one can lead to loading problems with some users who own computers don&#146;t allow the whole page to download.

&lt;br&gt;2006-02-16@23:37 [Walter] says Also, [Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpape]? could easily be moved to the primary node.

&lt;br&gt;Hello again Walter, The write up [Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper] is in a separate node because that is what the original author Charlotte Perkins Gilman  titled her article. I hope that helps!

Hi there, Bad news I'm afraid. This writeup doesn't appear to be compliant with the E2 Copyright Policy. For fair use compliance the quote should be less than 250 words total and 33% or less of the total wordcount. If you'd like to add more original content to bring it into compliance and repost, I'd be glad to assist you.&lt;br&gt;

2006-02-17@22:46 (9.5 hr) [liveforever] says re Billy, Don't Be a Hero -- I have expanded the lead-in text. Have a look and tell me if it meets the standards, now. Ta.&lt;br&gt;
2006-02-18@10:16 (liveforever) $ (1.6 min) XWiz says re Billy, Don't Be a Hero : The lyrics are now 252 words out of 667. That's still not quite 33 percent. A tiny bit more and you've got it. If you were to take the second chorus out and put 'repeat chorus' it'd be down to 30% which would be perfect. It's worth doing!&lt;br&gt;
[Liveforever]: Try it now.&lt;br&gt;
[XWiz]: (2006-02-19@0:12) Right, that's perfect and you've been perfect too! This is my first content salvage mission. You can append [CST Approved] to your node if you wish. Apologies if that doesn't come out right - as I say, it's my first proper one. Any complaints to Lometa , who's helping to train me up... :)
