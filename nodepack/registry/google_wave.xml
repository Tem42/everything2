  <doctext>[Google Wave] - [http://wave.google.com] was going to be, like, a whole new communication paradigm. Or something. 

It always seemed to mostly to consist of people going 'Has anyone figured out what this thing is good for yet?' - please let us know if you ever did. I guess the odds are against it - Google eventually decided to shut it down due to general public disinterest.

There's a general Everything2 wave you might like to join, but I can't find a way to link to it, so just /msg [Oolong[user]] if you want to join - or if you want an invitation, for that matter.</doctext>
